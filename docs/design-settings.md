 The design tab allows you to customize the look and feel of the checkout theme.

 The settings are divided into two groups, **Global Settings** and **Theme Specific Settings**.

### Logo

 Setting a logo is optional. If you do not provide a logo, we will use your site name (found under **Settings -&gt; General**).

### Footer Text

 By default, a standard copyright notice is displayed in the footer. If you would like to customize this text, you can enter your own text in the Footer Text WYSIWYG.
