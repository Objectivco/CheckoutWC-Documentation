 While we generally recommend adding custom PHP snippets to your theme's functions.php file or using the Snippets plugin, you can add PHP snippets directly to settings.

 Go to **WP Admin** &gt; **CheckoutWC** &gt; **Advanced**.

 You can enter your PHP snippets here:

Caveats
-------

 **You can break your site.** We try to protect you from doing that, but always test the front end of your site after adding or editing a PHP snippet.

 If you see an error, you can always return to admin and remove the offending snippet.
