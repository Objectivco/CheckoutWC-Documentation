<p>While we generally recommend adding custom PHP snippets to your theme's functions.php file or using the Snippets plugin, you can add PHP snippets directly to settings.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>WP Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>CheckoutWC</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong>.</p>
<p>You can enter your PHP snippets here:</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p><strong>You can break your site.</strong> We try to protect you from doing that, but always test the front end of your site after adding or editing a PHP snippet.</p>
<p>If you see an error, you can always return to admin and remove the offending snippet.</p>
