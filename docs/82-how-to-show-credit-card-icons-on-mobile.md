  <p>
    The credit card icons are hidden on mobile because screen real estate is usually too small to properly display them. If you want to show them anyway, this CSS snippet can be added to Settings &gt; Checkout for WooCommerce &gt; Design &gt; Custom CSS:
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/clifgriffin/4bbe5da9b12b7f0d634730c7fa4d2d99.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </p>
  <p>
    This may cause problems. Fixing the sizing will depend greatly on which gateway you are using, so your mileage will vary.&nbsp;
