 The text of many of the buttons throughout CheckoutWC can be changed via a filter. We have a how-to article for [adding a custom PHP snippet here](https://kb.checkoutwc.com/article/94-how-to-add-a-custom-php-snippet).

 Note: if you're looking for coupon related filters you can [find them here](https://kb.checkoutwc.com/article/113-how-to-change-enter-promo-code-text).

 Here is a list of the different button text filters.

- cfw\_return\_to\_customer\_info\_label
- cfw\_continue\_to\_payment\_method\_label
- cfw\_return\_to\_shipping\_method\_label
