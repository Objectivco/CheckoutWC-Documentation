  <p>
    If you wish to show which shipping method has been chosen in the shipping totals area of the cart summary, you can use this snippet:
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/clifgriffin/c9fbe2474eae670a04926dc4c9e01969.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can add this snippet one of several ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You can add it to your child theme's functions.php file
    </li>
    <li>You can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/" target="_blank">Code Snippets</a> plugin.
    </li>
    <li>Or you can add it to Settings &gt; CheckoutWC &gt; Premium Features &gt; PHP Snippets. (<strong>Plus, Pro</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Agency</strong> licenses only)
    </li>
  </ol>
