 Configuring an Order Bump is easy. Here's an explanation of each of the options:

Display Conditions
------------------

### Display Offer For

 This option allows you to decide who sees your bump.

#### All Products

 If you select *All Products*, the Bump will display on every order, regardless of which products are in the cart.

#### Specific Products

 If you select *Specific Products*, you will see two additional options:

 **Products**

 The list of products that will trigger the Bump to display if they are in the cart.

##### Condition

 When selecting Specific Products, you have an additional option, *Condition*. **Apply if all matching products are in the cart** means that every product in your Products list must be in the cart for the Bump to display.

 If this box is NOT checked, the Bump will display if *any* of the products in the Specific Products list is in the cart.

### Display Location

 We have two display options by default:

- Below Cart Items
- Above Terms and Conditions

 Note: On mobile, the bumps will always display above the terms and conditions.
