<p>Configuring an Order Bump is easy. Here's an explanation of each of the options:</p>
<h2>Display Conditions</h2>
<h3>Display Offer For</h3>
<p>This option allows you to decide who sees your bump.</p>
<h4>All Products</h4>
<p>If you select <em>All Products</em>, the Bump will display on every order, regardless of which products are in the cart.</p>

<p>If you select <em>Specific Products</em>, you will see two additional options:</p>
<p><strong>Products</strong></p>
<p>The list of products that will trigger the Bump to display if they are in the cart.</p>
<h5>Condition</h5>
<p>When selecting Specific Products, you have an additional option, <em>Condition</em>. <strong>Apply if all matching products are in the cart</strong> means that every product in your Products list must be in the cart for the Bump to display.</p>
<p>If this box is NOT checked, the Bump will display if <em>any</em> of the products in the Specific Products list is in the cart.</p>
<h3>Display Location</h3>
<p>We have two display options by default:</p>
