  <p>
    CheckoutWC includes built-in support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-mailerlite/" target="_blank">WooCommerce - MailerLite</a>.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation details:
  </p>
  <h2>
    Checkbox location
  </h2>
  <p>
    When MailerLite is activated with CheckoutWC, the newsletter subscribe checkbox will always show up right under the email field. (Specifically below the 'Create a shopping account' checkbox if present)
  </p>
  <h2>
    Other Settings
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you would like to not have a visible checkbox, you can set the checkbox to hidden in MailerLite settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's important to note that the Position setting is completely ignored when CheckoutWC is activated. The checkbox will always be added beneath the email field.
  </p>
