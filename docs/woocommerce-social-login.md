 You can use Checkout for WooCommerce with WooCommerce - Social Login.

 The best way to set this up is to use the Custom Hooks functionality in the Social Login settings:

 The best hook to use is probably `cfw\_checkout\_after\_login`, but you can use any of the hooks [in our documentation](https://kb.checkoutwc.com/article/25-actions).
