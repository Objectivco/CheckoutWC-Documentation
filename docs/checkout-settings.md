  <h2>
    Order Notes
  </h2>
  <p>
    Determine whether the order notes appear on the checkout page.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Skip Shipping Step
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you only have one shipping method, you can opt to hide the shipping step entirely by checking <strong>Skip shipping step</strong>.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Hide Coupon Code
  </h2>
  <p>
    When <strong>Enable to hide coupon code until link is clicked</strong>&nbsp;is checked the coupon code will not appear until the user clicks a link labeled 'Have a promo code? Click here.'
  </p>
  <h2>
    Login Style
  </h2>
  <p>
    By default, we show and hide the login form automatically based on whether we detect that the email address entered matches an existing account. To enable this behavior, select <strong>Enhanced</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you choose <strong>WooCommerce Default</strong>, this behavior will be replaced with an alert style message prompting the user to login above the form, the same as the native WooCommerce checkout page.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Registration Style
  </h2>
  <p>
    When Enhanced is selected, we will override WooCommerce's registration settings to automatically generate a username and password for customers. They will just see a 'Create account' checkbox.
  </p>
  <p>
    When <strong>WooCommerce Default</strong> is selected, CheckoutWC will respect the WooCommerce settings and offer a password field like the native WooCommerce checkout page.
  </p>
  <h2>
    User Matching
  </h2>
  <p>
    User Matching provides two features in one:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When a customer with an account places a guest order using the same email address as their account, we attach the order to their account.
    </li>
    <li>When a customer who has placed guest orders registers for the first time with the same email address, we match previous guest orders to their new account.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This feature is available to <strong>Plus</strong>, <strong>Pro</strong>, and <strong>Agency</strong> license holders.

    Mobile Options
  </h2>
  <p>
    Options that only affect the mobile view.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Mobile Coupon Field
  </h3>
  <p>
    When <strong>Show coupon field above payment options on mobile</strong> is checked, a separate coupon field is shown on mobile devices separate from the one in Cart Summary. This is to make it easier for customers to find the coupon field on mobile.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Show Credit Card Logos
  </h3>
  <p>
    By default we hide the credit card logos on mobile due to spacing issues. Check <strong>Show credit card logos on mobile</strong> to override this behavior.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Cart Summary Mobile Label
  </h3>
  <p>
    Determines what the label for the cart summary is on mobile. By default it's 'Show order summary'
  </p>
