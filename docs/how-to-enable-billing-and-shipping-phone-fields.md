<p>Prior to 2.22.0, phone field visibility was managed through General Settings.</p>
<p>However, starting with 2.22.0 we adopted the WooCommerce customizer settings to reduce confusion about how this works.</p>
<p>Simply click &quot;Customize&quot; at the top of the checkout page (you must be logged in as an admin!) and then click WooCommerce &gt; Checkout.</p>

<p>Enabling the phone field enables a billing <em>and</em> shipping phone field. We recommend you only enable the phone fields if they are truly neccessary for you to process orders.</p>
<p>You should never include optional phone fields. This creates extra work for your customers and may reduce conversions.</p>
