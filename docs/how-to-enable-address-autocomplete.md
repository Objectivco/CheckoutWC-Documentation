 Address Autocomplete allows customers to quickly fill in their address using Google Maps JavaScript API to intelligently find their address.

 If you have a **Pro** (5 Sites) or **Agency** (150 Sites) license, you can enable Address Autocomplete in **WP Admin** &gt; **CheckoutWC** &gt; **Checkout.**

 Configuring Google API Keys can be a bit tedious, to help guide you in the process we have created a separate doc: [How To Get and Configure Your Google API Key](https://kb.checkoutwc.com/article/86-how-to-get-and-configure-your-google-api-key)

 Check the box for "Enable address autocomplete" and then fill in your Google Maps JavaScript API Key:
