 If you are not happy with CheckoutWC and you are within 30 days of your purchase, we are happy to provide a refund.

 **We do not provide refunds for renewal payments after the first payment.** You will be notified of upcoming payments 2 weeks in advance, which provides you time to cancel you subscription if you do not wish to continue.

 To request a refund, open a [support ticket](https://www.checkoutwc.com/support/) and we'll take care of it promptly.
