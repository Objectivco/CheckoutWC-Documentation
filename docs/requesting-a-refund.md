<p>If you are not happy with CheckoutWC and you are within 30 days of your purchase, we are happy to provide a refund.</p>
<p><strong>We do not provide refunds for renewal payments after the first payment.</strong> You will be notified of upcoming payments 2 weeks in advance, which provides you time to cancel you subscription if you do not wish to continue.</p>
<p>To request a refund, open a <a href="https://www.checkoutwc.com/support/">support ticket</a> and we'll take care of it promptly.</p>
