 WooCommerce allows customers to pay for their orders using a special link that looks like this:

 **https://yoursite.com/checkout/order-pay/1234/?pay\_for\_order=true&amp;key=wc\_order\_FvNvVRjXin9HD**

 This is also used by some gateways that immediately redirect you to the order-pay endpoint after checkout. Previously this would fall back to the native WooCommerce templates.

 Starting in 2.31.0, CheckoutWC can handle the order-pay endpoint. You enable it in **WP Admin &gt; CheckoutWC &gt; Order Pay:**

 Once enabled, the order pay page looks like this:

 Please note: This premium feature is available to **Plus, Pro,** and **Agency** license holders.
