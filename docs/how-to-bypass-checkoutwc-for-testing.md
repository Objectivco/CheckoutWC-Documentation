  <p>
    If you need to test native WooCommerce checkout, you can do so without disabling CheckoutWC. Simply add this to your checkout URL:&nbsp;bypass-cfw=true
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    https://yoursite.com/checkout/?bypass-cfw=true
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a great idea to do whenever you have a problem. This helps confirm the problem you are seeing is unique to CheckoutWC and not a general bug.&nbsp;
