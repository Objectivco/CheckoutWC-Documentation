    We hope you don't want to, but if any reason you would like to cancel your trial, you can do so easily from <a href="https://www.checkoutwc.com/account/">Account</a>.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Under <strong>Subscriptions</strong> click "Cancel" on the right.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>NOTE: Your subscription will still say "Active" until your trial has expired, but you will not be billed</strong>
