We hope you don't want to, but if any reason you would like to cancel your trial, you can do so easily from [Account](https://www.checkoutwc.com/account/).

 Under **Subscriptions** click "Cancel" on the right.

 **NOTE: Your subscription will still say "Active" until your trial has expired, but you will not be billed**
