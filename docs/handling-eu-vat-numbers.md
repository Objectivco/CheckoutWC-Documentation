<p>We currently support two plugins for providing EU VAT Number support:</p>
<p>EU VAT Number:<br />
<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/eu-vat-number/%5D">https://woocommerce.com/products/eu-vat-number/</a></p>
<p>EU VAT Assistant:<br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-eu-vat-assistant/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-eu-vat-assistant/</a></p>
<p>We do not support any other plugins at this time as these options should provide all of the required functionality and are fully supported by our team in case of bugs or changes.</p>
