  <p>
    WooCommerce allows customers to pay for their orders using a special link that looks like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>https://yoursite.com/checkout/order-pay/1234/?pay_for_order=true&amp;key=wc_order_FvNvVRjXin9HD</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is also used by some gateways that immediately redirect you to the order-pay endpoint after checkout. Previously this would fall back to the native WooCommerce templates.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting in 2.31.0, CheckoutWC can handle the order-pay endpoint. You enable it in <strong>WP Admin &gt; CheckoutWC &gt; Order Pay:</strong>

    Once enabled, the order pay page looks like this:
