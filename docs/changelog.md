**Version 5.3.11 - 2021.10.04**

*   Hotfix - Ok, we didn't get that quite right:

    Fix cfw\_get\_shipping\_total()

    Essentially invert logic of cfw\_get\_shipping\_total() so that it follows the logic of WooCommerce's cart/cart-shipping.php template by first checking the available methods, and then descending into other checks.

    This also requires changing how cfw\_show\_shipping\_total() determines whether to show the shipping total. Since error states are part of the shipping total, those are pushed further down to cfw\_get\_shipping\_total() and instead we only check that we have shipping enabled and that the cart has items.

This release has a permanent fix, but  **after you update**please go to Settings > Checkout for WooCommerce > License and click "Deactivate" and then "Activate" again. This will ensure you have no future problems!

*   Fix: Fixed bug where 3rd party plugins calling update checkout threw a JS error.

**Version 2.19.0 - 05/07/2019**

This release continues to refactor the JS that runs the checkout page to make it simpler, more robust, and easier to debug. We test extensively with automated and manual tests, but as always please test before updating your live site. Your site is different than our test sites!

*   New: Added support for Mondial Relay shipment provider.
*   Improved: Added 3 coupon related JavaScript events: cfw-apply-coupon-success, cfw-apply-coupon-failure, cfw-apply-coupon-error, cfw-apply-coupon-complete
*   Improved: Added UI blocking to dynamic areas of the checkout page. During updates, the shipping address preview, shipping methods, cart, and place order button fade out and are unclickable until the checkout is up to date. 
*   Improved: When a update\_checkout call errors out because the server times out, or any other reason, the blocked UI portions will unblock. This ensures users can always retry without refreshing the page.
*   Improved: Ensure all update\_checkout calls use queueing system.

**Version 2.18.0 - 05/02/2019**

This release contains some changes to field labels and placeholders. All optional fields now include "(optional)" at the end of the placeholder and label. This is in keeping with best practices. Also, we're using the native WooCommerce label for address\_2, so instead of the abbreviation "Apt" it's now spelled out "Apartment". 

Lastly, the address\_2 field is now full width. This mitigates some display issues on smaller screens where the label was cut off. You can always remove this field entirely by [following this guide.](//kb.checkoutwc.com/article/64-how-to-remove-address-line-2)

*   Improved: Consistently apply optional notice to all optional fields.
*   Use WooCommerce native translation for most address fields.
*   Fix IE11 bug that showed select dropdown for countries without states.
*   Further improve cfw\_form\_field function automaticity. 

**Version 2.17.2 - 04/30/2019**

*   Also: Updated WooCommerce tested version number.

**Version 2.17.1 - 04/29/2019**

**Version 2.17.0 - 04/29/2019**

Another release, another round of refactoring. As always, please test before deploying to your live site. We test fanatically, but we can't test every configuration.

*   Improved: We're using vanilla WooCommerce localization scripts now. This sounds minor, but it was actually a pretty big refactor that fortunately allowed us to remove a lot of code that was proving to be difficult to maintain.
*   Improved: Improved styling of recurring totals and before totals areas of cart summary. 
*   Fixed: Fixed a few Firefox styling issues related to field heights and credit card icons.

**Version 2.16.1 - 04/26/2019**

🚨IMPORTANT: This update includes an important fix that requires a small template change. [Please follow this guide to update your template after updating to 2.16.1.](//kb.checkoutwc.com/article/66-upgrading-custom-templates-from-2-16-0-to-2-16-1)

*   Fix: WooCommerce 3.6 made a change to how customer data is loaded on the checkout page. Our attempts to fix this in 2.16.0 caused an issue with validation that caused a small number of stores to fail checkout submission for a fresh session in an incognito window. This is fixed now and we're very sorry for any disruptions this may have caused. 

**Version 2.16.0 - 04/24/2019**

This update has quite a few fixes in it. As always, please test before deploying to your live site. 🙏

**Version 2.15.1 - 04/13/2019**

Sometimes when your children keep you awake half of the night, you end up refactoring code in your head. My insomnia is your reward. 😴

We want to handle this within our template eventually, but due to complications this was the fastest path to success.

*   Fix: Works properly with "WooCommerce Ajax add to cart" (https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-ajax-add-to-cart/)
