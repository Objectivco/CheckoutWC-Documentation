<p>Generally we don't recommend having optional fields. If you don't need information to process an order, asking a customer to review an optional field is unnecessary friction that could hurt your conversion rate.</p>
<p>But if you want to add optional phone fields, this is managed through the WooCommerce customizer settings. Simply click &quot;Customize&quot; at the top of the checkout page (you must be logged in as an admin!) and then click WooCommerce &gt; Checkout.</p>

<p>Set <strong>Phone field</strong> to 'Optional'. This enables an optional billing <em>and</em> shipping phone field. We recommend you only enable the phone fields if they are truly neccessary for you to process orders.</p>
